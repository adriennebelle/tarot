    The day is long and full, but this Knight is in no hurry. Accomplishments dervied from haste tend to dissappiate sooner than anticipated, whereas work that is methodical goes the distance. Producing results can become frustrating. Teams may be uncooperative, personal drama can sway your focus, and essential pieces can be lost in the process. If your project seems to be going wrong in one way or another, then breathe and reasses what you still have to work with. Take stock of your strengths and inventory your advantages. Make a plan with what you still have going for you. If you're in the beginning stages of your project and are worried about what could go wrong, ask yourself what you are doing anyways? If it's nothing of importance, than perhaps this is the best time to try your hand at a new project. Doubt holds back the greatness in us. That good idea will still sound good even after the problems have been dealt with. If inertia is what's getting you sidetracked, try exercising to shake the funk and build up momentum. This card is about activity and progress, and exercise is proven to get your mind on the right track. Release some endorphins to give you a fighting spirit when the first obstacle presents itself and if you encounter a mental block, then getting your blood flowing will turn the wheels in your mind. The work described with this card is rarely glamorous. It's the "9-to-5" that keeps you looking forward to the weekend. This may be work that appears to benefit another, before it helps yourself. Make the most of it. Work is as much a part of life as is pleasure. Identify ways that your personal self is progressing by contributing to the daily grind of society. Look at how your actions and diligence impacts another person and appreciate the value your bring to the table. Consistency and commitment to quality will ensure incremental success. See your time through to the end of the project before deciding whether or not it was worth your effort.
