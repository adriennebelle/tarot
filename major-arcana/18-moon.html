    A symbol of intuition, dreams, and the unconscious. It illuminates the light from the sun to guide souls through the darkest of nights. The moon represents the unconscious currents of our mind. The sun may shine on us as we act, but the moon probes into our heart's yearning. You may feel uneasy as subconscious impulses are brought to light. Often these impulses have turned into bad habits that may wreak havoc without our direct consent. Memories may trigger emotional responses that are inappropriate for the present moment. Examine how you felt as a child and how you may be continuing the pattern of feelings into your current lifestyle. There may be fears or trauma that has yet to be dealt with and processed. A general sense of uncertainity may be regarded towards recent decisions. If these decisions turn out to be mistakes, take the time to recenter yourself before remedying the situation. Hasty action with a cloudy vision can spur on more damage. Overthinking may be the culprit, and if so, then this is a time to flow with your emotions and do what feels right. Intuitive reasoning will prove to be more effective than rational thinking. If your intuition is blocked with negativity such as doubt or depression, create the time to hone into your divine talents. Connecting with our spiritual selves and our instictive nature will point our willpower towards objects of true desire. Pay attention to dreams. The themes of our unconscious adventures offer clues to handle a particular situation or how it is likely to turn out. Sorting through subjective notions is often confusing. Limiting beliefs may manifest itself to poor habits which in turn repeats the cycle of doubt. The Moon offers a period of rest and to refresh mental states. Not everything needs to be sorted out, nor will all the information be present. You may be only working through the clues to a solution, but be demanded to act prior to being ready. It is important to see through the doubt and to trust in the process. Allow room for mistakes and misconceptions, as it is likely to arise given the circumstances. If you are struggling to make connections with intuitive insights, then try relaxing and doing something that will occupy the mind. Like how good ideas occur in the shower, taking your mind off the matter and focusing on mentally stimulating activities will allow for your subconscious to work in the background, processing the bits of information and form new perspectives.
