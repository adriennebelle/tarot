              To begin the consciousness journey, the Fool is both full of herself and full of wonder for what exists in the world. She is enthusiastic about the possibilities of life to the point that she overlooks any danger. She believes himself to be lucky and protected while learning the many life lessons she feels called to take on - and she is! Lacking concern for the consequences of her actions, she's known for giving the advice that everything will "work out". Some days, it does. Other days, she inserts her foot in her mouth, but it's all in good fun, or so her tells herself. The Fool is confident in her actions, courageous in the face of said danger, and is willing to bet it all on the chance for happiness. Living in the moment is the essence of this card, however the future is bright only if we cultivate the proper resources to come to our aid. Though joy may enter our lives when we throw caution to the wind, it quickly can escape our grasp like the wind itself.

            <p>While marching to the beat of our own drum, we may influence others to see what we see. This is empowering to know that our actions effect the lives of others, though we must handle this with honor. With few belongings, The Fool makes do with what she has. If you're feeling held back, The Fool encourages you to stretch the possibilities and to chase after the opportunities that are currently presenting itself. She reminds you that life is to be lived. Come what may, you will still be standing and your fear is not to be acted on. Live your life freely and have confidence in your abilities. In the event that this all sounds <i>too</i> familiar, then perhaps you need to reign back and assess why you're taking so many risks. Are your risks coming from creativity and love or are they to bloster your ego for others' sake? Are you mindful with your decision-making or are you acting willy-nilly with precious resources? The Fool is a good time, but in order to continue the good times, we need to assess ourselves often to ensure our prosperity. However, this card is by new beginnings, and its important to take a moment to bathe in the sense of a new door opening in our lives.</p>
