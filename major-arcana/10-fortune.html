        <p class="description">
          The wheel of fortune spins endlessly. Some days we feel on top of the world and at the top of the wheel; other days we could be dragged through the depths of despair. It's human nature to believe that fate has our best interest in favor. However true that may be, work cannot be stopped. If good fortune finds us, this is the time to count your blessings and practice gratitude. Fate and luck operate by chance. When the time comes for us to experience unfortunate events, it is worth realizing that we may be under the illusion of control. Our lives are a composite of many factors and we may blame ourselves more than we deserve.
